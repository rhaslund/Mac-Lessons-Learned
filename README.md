# Mac-Lessons-Learned
List of lessons learned as switching from Windows to Mac

- Move instead of copy in the finder: Hold CMD while drag and drop
- Set a monitor as primary: System Preferences > Display > Drap little white bar to desired primary monitor
- Prefer ethernet over wi-fi: System Preferences > Network > Click the little ... menu button > Set service order > Drag ethernet to top > OK > Click Apply button!
- Move a word at a time or mark a word at a time: ALT + ARROW / ALT+SHIFT + ARROW
- Prevent any application from adjusting the microphone level:
  1. Open the 'Audio MIDI Setup' application
  2. In the bottom left corner, click the + symbol and select Create aggregate device
  3. Select the new aggregate device, then tick the check in the Use column for your real microphone.
  4. Rename the new aggreate device to something useful so you know which one it is.

- Unable to "browse" the file system like in Windows File Explorer: Finder > Preferences > Sidebar > Put checkbox next to local computers name. Potentially add to finder favorites.
- Finder folders not sorting at the top: Finder > Preferences > Advanced > Keep folders on top > In windows when sorting by name
- CMD-TAB only shows apps, not windows of individual apps. Making it difficult to switch from one Google Chrome window to another. Use free ALT+TAB app: https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/
